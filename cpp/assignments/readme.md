# CP 123: INTRODUCTION TO HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING IN C++
## LAB 4 (week 8): ITERATION
Time: 31 May – 6 June 2021

1.	Explain the concept of function in programming.
2.	Discuss the concept of functions which do not pass parameter. In your discussion consider to include the following: meaning, syntax, example. From your example provided use RAM diagram to analyze/show the effect of execution of each line of code.
3.	Discuss the following function concepts. The function which does not return value to the calling function, and a function which return value to the calling function.
4.	Mr. Mtobesya requested your Lab group to design and implement a program to assist his child to do arithmetic operation. The program should accept two integers or floating point numbers. After processing the program should print the total, difference, product and quotient of the entered numbers. During processing, the first number should be considered as the dividend. The program should be able to check if the divisor is a non zero integer otherwise the output from division will be stated as haiwezekani. This program should have a selection engine implemented using switch case to select the operation to be performed. Organize the program into six functions: datainput, calsum, caldif, calpro, calqout, and dataoutput functions.

•	Use DDIV and IPO charts to analyze this scenario.
•	Implement the solution using C++ programming language.

1. Use functions which does not pass parameter and does not return value to calling function.
2. Use functions which does not pass parameter but return values to the calling function.

For each implementation modality above, analyze the execution of each line of code using the RAM diagram.

### NOTE:
1.	Use the groups formed for Lab 2
2.	100% will be awarded to the member who participated fully in discussion and attended the Lab session. Discussion is 60% and Lab attendance is 40%.
3.	Discussion can be done anywhere and any time starting from this first day.
4.	Submission is on Sunday 06/06/2021 at 18:00 P.M
5.	Submission for each group should include Lab attendance.
